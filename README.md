## Getting Started
  - Install all dependencies (pandas, pandas_datareader,...)
  - Download Files from Kaggle (see Link above)
  - Run file with Jupyter Notebook
  - Try new combinations of filtering out columns and params for Log. Regression

## Result
 - Prediction of non-Fraud pretty good (most of data is non-Fraud)
 - Algorithm detects most of frauds but high amount of false positives
 - More feature engineering needed to reduce false positives.
